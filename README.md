# vCompute
> Dynamic Shared Computing Module for Optimal Scalable Local Resource
> Sharing
## What is it
Through this module one can leverage the computing power of the systems connected to the network. Also one can share his system's computing power to the other systems connected on the network.

## Why it's cool
Technology is in great pace these days. We are using systems with more than enough computing power than we use it for. Why not share the computing power to do tasks which need massive computing and not possible for one single system to pull up. Using this module one can acquire the computing power of a group of connected systems. No special setup required. Highly scalable. Just imagine the possibilities.

## What your code is designed for 
This module is designed to share the resources of connected systems for computations dynamically. Using this module one can acquire the computing power of a group of connected systems. Its very similar to the concept of torrent but instead of data it distributes services.

## Technologies and architecture used
.NET 4.5, C#, WindowsForms, TCP Network Model Architecture

## What your code was written in
C#
